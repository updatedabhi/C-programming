# C Programming Learning Repository

Welcome to my C Programming Learning repository! This repo contains my exploration of C programming, ranging from basic syntax to advanced concepts. It includes exercises, examples, and small projects to help reinforce my understanding of C and assist others in their learning journey.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Basics**: Introduction to C syntax, data types, operators, and control flow.
- **Functions and Arrays**: Function definitions, passing parameters, and working with arrays.
- **Pointers**: Understanding pointer syntax, pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of linked lists, stacks, queues, and other essential data structures.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion, and other algorithmic techniques.

## üöÄ Key Topics

This repository covers a range of C programming topics including:

- Basic Syntax, Data Types, and Control Flow
- Functions, Recursion, and Scope
- Pointers, Memory Management, and Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Arrays and Strings
- Structures and Unions
- File I/O Operations
- Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Algorithm Design (Brute Force, Divide and Conquer, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Setup

To run the C code examples, follow these steps:
